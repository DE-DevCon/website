    <p>Welcome to the DE DevCon Call for Papers!  The CFP will close on {{ callForPapers.due|date('F jS, Y h:i:s A') }} EST.  Please make sure that you get your submissions in before that time!  No extensions will be granted.</p>

    <h3>What We Look For</h3>
    <p>We are looking for a variety of talks on work-related subjects. Talks should be 50 minutes in length. We want a wide variety of topics, including but not limited to DevOps, Big Data, and Agile Development.</p>
  <h3>What to expect</h3>
  <p>When the Call for Papers closes, the organizers will sort through the submissions, making their selections. Speakers will be notified no later than {{ callForPapers.selection|date('F jS, Y') }}. The goal is to give our speakers at least a month to prepare their presentations.</p>
  <hr />
    <h3>Suggestions to Get Accepted</h3>
  <p>We strongly encourage potential speakers to submit more than one submission on more than one topic. The more submissions you contribute, the more options you give us to choose you as a speaker. Be sure your talk title and abstract define the exact topic you want to speak about and what you hope people will learn from the session.</p>
  <hr />

    <h3>Talk Types</h3>
    <h4>Tutorials</h4>
    <p>These will take place on Thursday and are 3 hours long. Attendees here will expect in-depth coverage of a specific topic.</p>
    <h4>Regular talks</h4>
    <p>These take place throughout the rest of the conference and are 50 minutes long, including the Q &amp; A.</p>
    <h4>Short talks</h4>
    <p>We sometimes leave space on the schedule for short talks are only thirty minutes long. Sometimes there are topics that donâ€™t need a full 50 minutes.  We want to make sure we allow these kinds of topics to be exposed.</p>
    <h3>Equipment and Setup</h3>
    <p>Each presenter will be responsible for contacting the 20th floor to ensure their equipment compatiable with the speakers needs.  We will hold a short orientation prior to the conference to ensure
each presenter knows what is expected.</p>
    <h3>Speaker Package</h3>
    <p>If selected you will receive a t-shirt and collectable stuffed narwhal.</p>
