Here are some of the things we use Jenkins to accomplish at ForRent:</p>
<ul>
<li>A myriad of systems processes (normally handled by hand in crontab) that need to run visibly on schedule and on many different servers.</li>
<li>Orchestrating code deployment through a rigid workflow that allows semi-continuous integration of releases</li>
<li>Automated testing of many regions of the ForRent.com though hundreds of tests organized into suites.</li>
<li>Data Exchange processes for importing and exporting data to and from vendors.</li>
<li>Extract/Translate/Load processes to migrate data from authoritative SQL environments to caching and service layers.</li>
