Those without a public GitHub account or laptop will still be able to participate as pull requests will be displayed on the screen.

Go is a relatively easy language to learn, but it can be difficult to know where to start especially if you come from a background of interpreted or dynamically typed languages. In this talk we\'ll introduce the basic language syntax and features as well as the tools that make learning the language easier. The goal of this talk is for everyone to learn go.

Jenkins is an incredibly powerful tool on its own yet also contains an extensive plugin set and vibrant community of developers around the world. Here are some of the things we use Jenkins to accomplish at ForRent:</p>
<ul>
<li>A myriad of systems processes (normally handled by hand in crontab) that need to run visibly on schedule and on many different servers.</li>
<li>Orchestrating code deployment through a rigid workflow that allows semi-continuous integration of releases</li>
<li>Automated testing of many regions of the ForRent.com though hundreds of tests organized into suites.</li>
<li>Data Exchange processes for importing and exporting data to and from vendors.</li>
<li>Extract/Translate/Load processes to migrate data from authoritative SQL environments to caching and service layers.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Focus of the talk will be an overall introduction to Jenkins, some of the common terminology, basic setup.  I will try to dive into configuration, building projects and talking about some key plugins to make Jenkins as powerful as it can be.</p>",
